# Merkle-Tree

An implementation of a Merkle Tree (Binary Hash Tree).

Merkle Trees are used to verify data integrity over an untrusted network. For example, they are used by Bitcoin's blockchain as a means of storing transactions in a block. This allows SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) Nodes to verify the existence of a transaction within a particular block without downloading the block's entire list (tree) of transactions.
